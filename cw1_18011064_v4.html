		Changelog 
		15/10/2018 Template released, the basic template was tested - mouse tracking is partially complete, colour selection is partially complete
		24/02/2019 Set canvas to 800x600 pixels, extended functionality implemented in the first colour selector to the other three and tested
				  Expanded canvas function so that it actually works and resets the canvas' background colour to the currently selected colour
				   Added 4 extra colours to bring total to 8, border colour is changed to white when element is selected, created function to reset border colour back to default once another colour has been selected
	
	
		Suggested Tasks:
		1. Take time to fully review and become familiar with this template and ensure it works (in the sense that there are no errors).
		2. Fully read the assignment brief - it contains all the requirements and details you need to design, test and implement
		3. After each development cycle (e.g. any time spent programming - this could be an hour to several hours) you are expected to add a changelog entry; each entry should include the date followed by a single sentence that describes what has been changed, updated, added, fixed etc (Please note this is a CORE expectation and requirements, get in to the habit of added them as you go!)
		4. After you have implemented a requirement (there are 11 in total; these are described in sections 2 & 3 of the Marks Awarded section of the assignment brief) conduct and document a test to check whether the implemented requirement works as expected and as needed.  Record these tests in the test log section located and the bottom of this page.
		5. You are not allowed to remove any code already provided but you can expand and further develop it
			5a. Any new functions must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. fnPaint should be fnPaint_MW)
			5b. Any new variables must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. iMouseX the initial "i" to indicate it will hold an integer value or sColour to indicate a string value)
			5c. Change the name of this template so that YOUR ACTUAL student id replaces the word "studentid" in the filename 
		6. Work to complete the various requirements - start with the simplest, 
			6a. Review and work out how to set the canvas to a more appropriate size (e.g. 800 pixels wide and tall)
			6b.	Extend the functionality implemented in the first colour selector to the other three
			6c. Expand the fnClearCanvas function so that it actually works
			6d. Work out how to enhance the clear canvas function so that it resets the canvas' background colour to the currently selected colour; 
				dont forget to update the important variables (e.g. sCanvasColour)
			6e. Extend the colour selection tools so that there are eight working tools
			6f. Design some method to indicate which colour is active; this should automatically change as soon as a new colour is selected
			6g. This template includes some interested opportunities to explore holding down the control, alt and shift keys while moving the mouse; 
				see if you can somehow use these examples to add implement any of the requirements (e.g. erase mode, brush size, etc.) - remember,
				don't try to solve the whole thing in a single instance, build it up little by little, keep copies of your work so if everything breaks
				you can also return to a working version and try again

		Critical note:
			Please ensure that you maintain and use the expected programming standards outlined in the brief in the Marks Awarded section 4.1 to 4.5 (Programming Standards and Documentation) - especially the use of the REQUIRED function and variable naming convention /

			You will be expected to maintain, program and submit neat code that fully supports appropriate indentation and comments - don't forget failure to maintain standards will result in a significant penalty.  

		Good luck, before we leave you to get on with this - remember, by completing the tutorial sessions and practicalâ€™s all this should (at least) be familiar; complete the tutorials before attempting to program this system.
