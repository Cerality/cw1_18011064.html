		Changelog 
		15/10/2018 Template released, the basic template was tested - mouse tracking is partially complete, colour selection is partially complete
		24/02/2019 Set canvas to 800x600 pixels, extended functionality implemented in the first colour selector to the other three and tested
				  Expanded canvas function so that it actually works and resets the canvas' background colour to the currently selected colour
				   Added 4 extra colours to bring total to 8, border colour is changed to white when element is selected, created function to reset border colour back to default once another colour has been selected
		06/03/2019 Fixed css hover not working after colour selected
					Fixed colour not being indicated when page first loaded
					Added 4 brush size selectors - i'm looking to improve the look of these at a later date 
		07/03/2019 Renamed brush size function to just a size function, as when new features are added. this will be used for them aswell
					Fixed issue with size decreasing below zero, and then fixed issue with size not increasing once it reached 2
					Added display for the primary and background colours, and size.
					Created ideaslog to keep track of new ideas or things I still need to implement
		08/03/2019 Minor variable name changes and added extra comments (e.g. oFirstColour to oInitialColour)
					Added return to default button which returns all canvas settings e.g. colour, size and background to the originals on load
					Added eraser button/mode
					Added update indicators function which can be called to update all the display indicators
					Fixed all errors which were recorded in last test log
		08/03/2019	Added mode indicator display and fixed errors found after testing
					Fixed mouse pointer not exactly on brush by offsetting according to the brush size
		09/03/2019  Added sliders and colour box for the user to chose their own rgb colour and paint with it
					Minor change to the brush sizes (made large and largest a bit bigger)
					
					
		Ideaslog and need to implement later log: Found myself thinking of more ideas than I can implement at a time so keeping a log to track things i need to add later
		Spray mode
		Alert/ alert box when canvas reset button is pressed so the user knows to change colour to begin painting again
		Css improvement/ make it look better
		Indication of where mouse is in eraser mode?
		Undo/redo functions
					
		Suggested Tasks:
		1. Take time to fully review and become familiar with this template and ensure it works (in the sense that there are no errors).
		2. Fully read the assignment brief - it contains all the requirements and details you need to design, test and implement
		3. After each development cycle (e.g. any time spent programming - this could be an hour to several hours) you are expected to add a changelog entry; each entry should include the date followed by a single sentence that describes what has been changed, updated, added, fixed etc (Please note this is a CORE expectation and requirements, get in to the habit of added them as you go!)
		4. After you have implemented a requirement (there are 11 in total; these are described in sections 2 & 3 of the Marks Awarded section of the assignment brief) conduct and document a test to check whether the implemented requirement works as expected and as needed.  Record these tests in the test log section located and the bottom of this page.
		5. You are not allowed to remove any code already provided but you can expand and further develop it
			5a. Any new functions must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. fnPaint should be fnPaint_MW)
			5b. Any new variables must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. iMouseX the initial "i" to indicate it will hold an integer value or sColour to indicate a string value)
			5c. Change the name of this template so that YOUR ACTUAL student id replaces the word "studentid" in the filename 
		6. Work to complete the various requirements - start with the simplest, 
			6a. Review and work out how to set the canvas to a more appropriate size (e.g. 800 pixels wide and tall)
			6b.	Extend the functionality implemented in the first colour selector to the other three
			6c. Expand the fnClearCanvas function so that it actually works
			6d. Work out how to enhance the clear canvas function so that it resets the canvas' background colour to the currently selected colour; 
				dont forget to update the important variables (e.g. sCanvasColour)
			6e. Extend the colour selection tools so that there are eight working tools
			6f. Design some method to indicate which colour is active; this should automatically change as soon as a new colour is selected
			6g. This template includes some interested opportunities to explore holding down the control, alt and shift keys while moving the mouse; 
				see if you can somehow use these examples to add implement any of the requirements (e.g. erase mode, brush size, etc.) - remember,
				don't try to solve the whole thing in a single instance, build it up little by little, keep copies of your work so if everything breaks
				you can also return to a working version and try again

		Critical note:
			Please ensure that you maintain and use the expected programming standards outlined in the brief in the Marks Awarded section 4.1 to 4.5 (Programming Standards and Documentation) - especially the use of the REQUIRED function and variable naming convention /

			You will be expected to maintain, program and submit neat code that fully supports appropriate indentation and comments - don't forget failure to maintain standards will result in a significant penalty.  

		Good luck, before we leave you to get on with this - remember, by completing the tutorial sessions and practicalâ€™s all this should (at least) be familiar; complete the tutorials before attempting to program this system.

		Test Log
		*****************************************************************************************
		Test Date, Use & Operatins No (1-6), Description, What did you test, Results, Reflections			
		*****************************************************************************************
		24/02/2019, (4), 4 working colours, tested each colour works and that it changes correctly, all 4 colour selectors are working, will add further colour selectors at a later date 	
		24/02/2019, (6), clear canvas and resets to currently selected fill colour, that is approriately resets the canvas to the currently chosen colour, success!, need to add functionality to show current background/canvas colour to user at a later date
		24/02/2019, (4), 8 colours, active colour is indicated, that each colour is highlighted when active and that non-active colours return to default border colour, success!, can use the same function for the control tools
		06/03/2019, (4,6), Testing after return to coding, retested all parts of the current code, all, the css hover stops working after a colour is selected; when page is first loaded the colour is black, but that is not indicated; otherwise successful, will fix and update in the change log
		06/03/2019, (3), Brush size selectors, that they change the brush size, success! all working correcting, need to add an indicator of current brush size in next session of coding
		07/03/2019, (3), Brush size increase/decrease, that the increase/decrease buttons worked, they do function however they can decrease to 0/negative, need to input a function to stop this, otherwise works well
		07/03/2019, (3), Brush size increase/decrease, that it didn't go below 2/negative, once it reaches size 2, it won't increase, need to fix this otherwise it works great
		07/03/2019, (1,3,4,6), General test, testing everything after a session of coding, everything works as expected except doesnt paint on mouse pointer exactly when size is larger and the size display does not change when a specified size is selected (does when increase/decrease is selected). fixed size display by adding code to update it and will fix the mouse pointer issue next session
		08/03/2019, (1,2,3,4,6), General test, testing everything after a session of coding, (return to default does reset highlight of colours, background colour only updates after pressing default button twice, hard to see where brush will erase in eraser mode- add to ideaslog, brush size does not return to default), overall progressing well will fix these before I start v9 or add to ideaslog
		08/03/2019, (1,2), Display indicator for mode, indicator for mode, mode indicator starts as undefined, eraser mode takes two presses to update indicator otherwise works as expected, need to set mode in fnInitialise and update indicators in eraser function
		08/03/2019, (1,3), Paint and size change, that it paints exactly underneath the mouse, it always paints underneath the mouse no matter the size, good solution implemented
		09/03/2019, (5), blender tool, that the blender tool allows a custom rgb colour to be created and selected, colour of the box to show custom rgb colour does not work- the correct value shows in debug message however, need to ensure the rgb colour variable used to colour the element is a string!
		09/03/2019, (5). blender tool, same as previous entry, success! user can create custom colour and paint with it - everything else interacts with no errors and as expected, great most of the main features are finished
